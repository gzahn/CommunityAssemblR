Title: Generates and Manipulates Community Matrices to Simulate Microbiome Transplantation Assembly Processes
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This is a modular set of tools for building and altering community matrices. The standard community matrix gives abundance counts for N taxa (columns) in N samples (rows). There are also tools for simulating transplantations from a donor community to a resident community under various theoretical situations. These functions are intended to be modular and chainable so that a unique community can be progressively built that reflects a variety of selective pressures. This community can then be used to test the detection accuracy of predictive assembly models.
